India’s Muslim population—its largest religious minority, comprising nearly 14% of the total population—has faced **increased socio-political marginalisation** since 2020, according to multiple human rights groups and constitutional scholars.

The marginalisation is not sudden; it is rooted in long-standing communal politics and structural exclusion. However, analysts argue that the policies and rhetoric of the **Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)** government have accelerated a trend toward alienation, particularly through laws, police action, and social media narratives.

## Citizenship and Legal Exclusion

The most prominent flashpoint came in **2019–2020** with the introduction of the **Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)** and the proposed **National Register of Citizens (NRC)**.

- **CAA** offers a pathway to Indian citizenship for non-Muslim immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh—excluding Muslims from the same benefit.
- The **NRC**, first implemented in Assam, left nearly **1.9 million people stateless**, disproportionately affecting poor and Muslim families lacking documentation.

> "For the first time in independent India, religion became an explicit basis for citizenship," said a constitutional law professor in New Delhi.

## Communal Violence and Policing

Since 2020, several states—including Delhi, Assam, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh—have witnessed **communal clashes**. Investigations into these incidents often revealed:

- **Targeted demolition of Muslim homes and businesses**, often without legal notice.
- **Selective arrests and charges** against Muslim activists and protestors.
- **Inaction or complicity** by local law enforcement in the face of hate speech or vigilante violence.

One of the most chilling examples was the **2020 Delhi riots**, where more than **50 people were killed**, the majority of them Muslim. Activists and opposition leaders accused the state machinery of turning a blind eye—or worse, enabling the violence.

## Social Discrimination and Economic Impact

Beyond the headlines, India's Muslims face **discrimination in education, housing, and employment**. A 2022 survey by the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) found that:

- **61% of Muslim respondents** felt that their identity negatively affected job opportunities.
- **Many landlords refused** to rent homes to Muslim families, especially in urban areas.
- Muslims were significantly underrepresented in public institutions, from the judiciary to academia.

The **Sachar Committee Report (2006)** had already outlined stark inequalities, but little systemic progress has followed.

## Public Discourse and Hope

Despite growing polarisation, **civil society groups, legal activists, students, and secular coalitions** continue to fight for inclusion and equality.

Protests such as the **Shaheen Bagh movement**, led by Muslim women, became a symbol of peaceful resistance. The **Supreme Court of India** has also issued notices questioning arbitrary demolitions and detentions, though action remains limited.

---

## Conclusion

The marginalisation of Muslims in India reflects broader questions about the future of secularism, democracy, and pluralism in the country. As calls for **constitutional safeguards, anti-discrimination laws, and judicial independence** grow stronger, the struggle remains far from over.

India’s promise of “unity in diversity” is being tested—and so far, it's civil society and grassroots voices that are keeping that ideal alive.
