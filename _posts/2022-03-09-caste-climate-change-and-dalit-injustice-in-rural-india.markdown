As India continues to grapple with intensifying climate crises—heatwaves, floods, and droughts—experts and activists warn that **climate change is not caste-neutral**. Among the hardest hit are **Dalit communities**, whose socio-economic and caste status leaves them **systematically excluded from access to relief, resources, and infrastructure**.

## Water Access Denied by Caste

In 2022, data from climate and social justice studies revealed that **over 48% of drought-affected villages in states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh reported discrimination against Dalits in accessing water from shared village sources**.

Even in times of severe water scarcity, **dominant-caste groups often restrict Dalits from using common wells or hand pumps**, forcing them to walk longer distances or rely on contaminated sources.

> "The well might be public, but access to it isn’t. This is environmental apartheid," said a water-rights activist from Tamil Nadu.

## Caste and Climate Vulnerability

Dalits, who predominantly live in **geographically marginal and underdeveloped areas**, face increased risks when climate disasters strike. For example:

- During floods, **relief camps are often set up in dominant-caste areas**, where Dalits are unwelcome.
- **Heatwaves kill more Dalits**, who work in exposed outdoor labor with minimal protective rights or access to cool shelter.
- **Landlessness** means Dalits often settle on flood-prone or drought-hit land with no state support.

These vulnerabilities are **not accidental**, but the outcome of decades of caste-based segregation in land distribution, public service access, and disaster policy design.

## The Call for Climate Justice

Dalit activists, environmental scholars, and grassroots organizations are now linking the **caste question to climate resilience policy**. There are growing demands for:

- **Equitable distribution of climate funds** to improve access in Dalit-majority villages.
- **Inclusive disaster relief frameworks** that account for caste-based exclusion.
- Recognition of **caste as a factor** in vulnerability mapping and climate-risk assessments.

Legal scholars also point out the need for **enforceable anti-discrimination protections** during relief operations, especially in water access, sanitation, and housing.

## Conclusion

The intersection of caste and climate change in India is a stark reminder that **vulnerability is socially constructed**. Without caste-aware environmental policy, India risks replicating centuries of social injustice through its climate response.

As the planet warms, **the question is no longer just about carbon—but about caste, justice, and dignity**.
